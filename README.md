# Polynomial expansion

The app takes a polynomial written as a product of linear factors and returns the same polynomial in the standard form.

Scale and zeroes of the input polynomial can be either input in the UI or taken from a file (hardcoded to be `values.txt`).

The conversion algorithm is implemented in both C# and x64 Assembly.

## UI

The UI is made in [Windows Presentation Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation).

Input data taken from the UI:

Input data taken from the file (values in the Ui are ignored):
